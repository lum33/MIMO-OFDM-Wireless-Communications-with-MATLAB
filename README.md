# Some MATLAB practices from textbook: MIMO-OFDM-Wireless-Communications-with-MATLAB
1. channel_estimation.m is the main code; LS_CE.m, MMSE_CE.m, and interpolate.m is the function programs.
2. After listening to professor's advice, channel_estimation2.m is written to generate average MSE v.s. SNR graph. MMSE's data is weird since MMSE should be better than LS method.
